##Homework 2: Question 1
```
XX <- 0:30
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = XX, lambda = l)

##1.a. What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

A <- 1-(ppois(q =7, lambda = l, lower.tail = TRUE))
A

##1.b. What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

B <- dpois (x = 0, lambda = l)
B

##1.c. What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

C <- dpois (x = 3, lambda = l)
C

##1.d. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ xx ≤ 30.
barplot(probset, names.arg = XX, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(XX = x)", main = paste0("Probability Mass Function for XX\nlambda = ", l))

##1.e. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
E <- rpois(n = 104, lambda = l)
##1.f. Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. 
hist(E, breaks = 0:30,  probability = TRUE, main = paste("Histogram of Sample of", 
    "Calls"),xlim = range(0:30), xlab = "Calls", ylab = "Frequency")
##How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?
##More sporatic but still dense around 15 calls.

##2.a. Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random 
## variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education).

##2.b. Use {ggplot} and make boxplots of each of these variable by gender
ht <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = height))
ht <- ht + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE)
ht <- ht + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

ye <- ye + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE)
ye <- ye + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
ye <- ye + ylab("Years of Education")
ye

##2.c. Use {ggplot} and make scatterplots of height and weight 
##in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?
##Yes, height and weight increase with age. The relationship is stronger with height.

ah <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = height))  
ah <- ah + xlab("age") + ylab("height")
ah <- ah + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) #makes it a scatterplot
ah 

aw <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight))  
aw <- aw + xlab("age") + ylab("weight")
aw <- aw + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) #makes it a scatterplot
aw

##2.d. Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to 
##be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not?

#2.e. Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombies (without replacement)
#from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable.

#for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, 
#you will need to base your estimate of the CIs on some different distribution!

##2.f. Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombies out and calculate the mean for each of 
##the these samples. Together with the first sample you drew out, you now have a set of 100 means
##for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution 
##for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of the sampling distribution for
##each variable? How do the standard deviations compare to the standard errors estimated in [2.e.]? 
##What do these sampling distributions look like? Are they normally distributed? What about for 
##those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution?
